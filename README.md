# Yuu

A VuePress theme that supports multiple color themes and some other useful features. Heavily based off of the default VuePress theme.

## Installation

You can add Yuu to your current VuePress project by running:

```bash
yarn add vuepress-theme-yuu

# or if you prefer npm
npm install vuepress-theme-yuu
```

## Features/configuration

Everything that's supported in the 0.14.1 version of the default VuePress theme is supported on Yuu. Updates will be made occassionally to try to keep up with the default's themes features and CSS and etc.

Below is a list of the additional configurable features Yuu has to offer.

### Dark theme

Yuu, by default, comes with an option to allow users to switch to a dark theme. You can disable this via the `disableDarkTheme` option.

```js
module.exports = {
	themeConfig: {
		yuu: {
			disableDarkTheme: true,
		},
	},
};
```

You can also change dark theme enabled by default via the `defaultDarkTheme` option.

```js
module.exports = {
	themeConfig: {
		yuu: {
			defaultDarkTheme: true,
		},
	},
};
```

### Color themes

Yuu currently supports 3 color themes: the default (green) theme, a blue theme, and a red theme. By default, any additional themes will be included. If you only want to use certain themes, you'll need to be explicit about which ones.

```js
module.exports = {
	themeConfig: {
		yuu: {
			colorThemes: ['red'],
		},
	},
};
```

You can also change default color theme via the `defaultTheme` option, available values are `green`, `blue` and `red`.

```js
module.exports = {
	themeConfig: {
		yuu: {
			defaultTheme: 'blue',
		},
	},
};
```

#### Forced color themes per page

You can force themes on a per page basis as well. Using YAML front matter on the page(s) you want to display a specific theme:

```md
---
forceTheme: blue
---
```

#### Disallowing forced themes from being ignored

Users will still be able ignore forced themes via the user settings dropdown menu. You can disable this via the `disableThemeIgnore` option.

```js
module.exports = {
	themeConfig: {
		yuu: {
			disableThemeIgnore: true,
		},
	},
};
```

### Extra options

If you want to add your own options to the dropdown menu, you can do so via the `extraOptions` setting. The strings provided are the names of the components to use (most likely located in your `/docs/.vuepress/components/` directory).

```js
module.exports = {
	themeConfig: {
		yuu: {
			extraOptions: {
				above: 'AboveContent',
				below: 'BelowContent',
			},
		},
	},
};
```
